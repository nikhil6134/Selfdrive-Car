<h1> Introduction to project </h1>
<br>
In this project we are building a driver class using pytorch,kivy,anaconda and python.  build our own self driving car This is going to be a modelled version of a car but still  it will learn how to drive itself. And the key word here is learn,because the car will not be given any rules on how to operate in the environment before hand it will have to figure everything out on it's own.

<hr>
<br>
step 1 :  download Anaconda on the basis of your version of python you are using .it is either pyhton 2 or either python 3
<br>

step 2: install kivy in anaconda -:
open anaconda command prompt and type this command-:
$ conda install kivy -c conda-forge
<br>
step 3: install pytorch in anaconda-:
<br>
open anaconda command prompt and type this command 
<br>
conda install pytorch -c pytorch
<br>
pip install torchvision
<br>
you can check the list your packages install in your conda by typing this command
<br>
conda list
<br>
step 3: Now open spyder and here we write our code here.
<br>
<h1> Model used-:</h1>
<br>
Deep Q learing model is used in this project. Deep Q learning model is the combination of Q learning model and Artificial neural networks.
